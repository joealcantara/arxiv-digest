      "abstract": "We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

      "abstract": "Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge. We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.",

      "abstract": "Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.   We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.   We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.",

      "abstract": "This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.",

We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.",

      "abstract": "Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.",

      "abstract": "Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level \"thought\" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.",

To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.",

We present its axiomatization that is \\emph{sound} with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. In addition, both the necessity and sufficiency fragments of the logic are also individually complete with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. We highlight the expressive power of the logic with some illustrative examples. As a formal context is the basic construct of formal concept analysis (FCA), we generalize three main notions in FCA, i.e., formal concepts, object oriented concepts, and property oriented concepts, to their corresponding $c$-cut concepts in fuzzy formal contexts. Then, we show that our logical language can represent all three of these generalized notions. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of extending our logic to reasoning with multi-relational fuzzy contexts, in which the Boolean combinations of different fuzzy relations are allowed.",

To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news \"slop.\" Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.   Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.   Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.",

In this work, we develop ShowUI-$\u03c0$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$\u03c0$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach.

Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.   We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.   From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).",

      "abstract": "We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.",

      "abstract": "Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $\u03bb$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control. Source code and benchmark environments will be made publicly available.",

RAIR established a standardized framework for relevance assessment and provides a set of universal rules, which forms the foundation for standardized evaluation. Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance.

By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.",

However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms.",

To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and duration. The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.",

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.",

We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.",

The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.",

Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator.

      "abstract": "We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.",

While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.",

Recent advances in generative models have shown promise in slate recommendation by modeling sequences of discrete semantic IDs autoregressively. However, existing autoregressive approaches suffer from semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks holistic slate planning. To address these limitations, we propose HiGR, an efficient generative slate recommendation framework that integrates hierarchical planning with listwise preference alignment. First, we propose an auto-encoder utilizing residual quantization and contrastive constraints to tokenize items into semantically structured IDs for controllable generation. Second, HiGR decouples generation into a list-level planning stage for global slate intent, followed by an item-level decoding stage for specific item selection. Third, we introduce a listwise preference alignment objective to directly optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback. Experiments on our large-scale commercial media platform demonstrate that HiGR delivers consistent improvements in both offline evaluations and online deployment. Specifically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in offline recommendation quality with a 5x inference speedup, while further achieving a 1.22% and 1.73% increase in Average Watch Time and Average Video Views in online A/B tests.",

Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains.

Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.",

      "abstract": "The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.   To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass \"generate-then-segment\" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a \"Generate-Evaluate-Evolve\" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.",

While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their \"black-box\" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a \"numerical-semantic\" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from \"passive detection\" to \"intelligent diagnosis\" for battery safety management.",

We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.",

However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Our method builds on a novel, learned feature-based image representation that disentangles different types of features, such as geometry and contrast, into distinct low-dimensional latent spaces, enabling better exploitation of feature correlations in multidimensional images and incorporation of pre-learned priors specific to different feature types for reconstruction. More specifically, the disentanglement was achieved via an encoderdecoder network and image transfer training using large public data, enhanced by a style-based decoder design. A latent diffusion model was introduced to impose stronger constraints on distinct feature spaces. New reconstruction formulations and algorithms were developed to integrate the learned representation with a zero-shot selfsupervised learning adaptation and subspace modeling. The proposed method has been evaluated on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, without task-specific supervised training or fine-tuning. This work offers a new strategy for learning-based multidimensional image reconstruction where only limited data are available for problem-specific or task-specific training.",

      "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.",

They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.",

We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.",

Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.",

      "abstract": "Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate correct patches for buggy programs. Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.   To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.",

We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment. These results highlight the potential of quantitative voice biomarkers as scalable, non-invasive tools for early screening, diagnostic triage, and longitudinal monitoring of vocal health.",

      "abstract": "Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.",

We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.",

      "abstract": "Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.   B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.",

Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology.

These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.",

Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.",

We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.",

Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $\u03b8_0$ with current iterate $\u03b8_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(\u03b8_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $\u03b8_0$, $\u03b8_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors. We illustrate and supplement these theoretical findings with experiments on generalized linear models.",

Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task.

DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels",

Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.   We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.   From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).",

This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $\u03bb$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control.

      "abstract": "Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.",

We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.",

We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources.

This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.   We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.",

Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.",

Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability.

We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability.

In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.",

However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results.

In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling.

Part I: 1-Categories contains 100 fully formalized statement-level tasks, curated into topic families and three difficulty tiers via an LLM-assisted + human grading process. The best model solves 8.25% of tasks at pass@1 (32.50%/4.17%/0.00% by Easy/Medium/High) and 12.00% at pass@4 (50.00%/4.76%/0.00%). We also evaluate LeanBridge which use LeanExplore to search Mathlib, and observe consistent gains over single-model baselines. LeanCat is intended as a compact, reusable checkpoint for tracking both AI and human progress toward reliable, research-level formalization in Lean.",

      "abstract": "The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.   We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.",

These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\\partial L / \\partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.",

In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.",

Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \\& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles.

To address this, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework that jointly optimizes all four criteria via the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), generating a diverse Pareto front of trade-off solutions. We use a specific selection mechanism to extract a premium on this front.

To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \\times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.",

However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.   To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.",

We propose \\textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.   We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.",

In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.",

However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.",

We propose MP-Jacobi (Message Passing-Jacobi), a graph-compliant decentralized framework that couples min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters. At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates. This design uses only single-hop communication and yields a convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.   For strongly convex objectives we establish global linear convergence and explicit rates that quantify how curvature, coupling strength, and the chosen partition affect scalability and provide guidance for clustering. To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity. We further extend MP-Jacobi to hypergraphs; in heavily overlapping regimes, a surrogate-based hyperedge-splitting scheme restores finite-time intra-cluster message updates and maintains convergence.

We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robots operating in complex, dynamic environments face the dual challenge of navigating large-scale, structurally diverse spaces with static obstacles while safely interacting with various moving agents. Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.",

We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.",

We confirm that classical approaches retain high-order accuracy and strong computational efficiency for single-instance problems in the one-dimensional setting. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are also able to reproduce qualitative solutions but are generally less accurate and less efficient in low dimensions than classical solvers due to expensive training and slow convergence. We also investigate the operator-learning methods, which, although computationally intensive during training, can be reused across many parameter instances, providing rapid inference after pretraining, making them attractive for applications involving repeated simulations or real-time predictions. For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general.",

      "abstract": "Benign laryngeal voice disorders affect nearly one in five individuals and often manifest as dysphonia, while also serving as non-invasive indicators of broader physiological dysfunction. We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment. These results highlight the potential of quantitative voice biomarkers as scalable, non-invasive tools for early screening, diagnostic triage, and longitudinal monitoring of vocal health.",

      "abstract": "Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior. We introduce the first $\\textbf{compression-aware scaling law}$, which disentangles token-level capacity, concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, enabling principled compute allocation under fixed FLOPs. To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\\textbf{decoupled $\u03bc$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\\textbf{+2.69$\\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.",

      "abstract": "Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.   B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.",

AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection.

      "abstract": "Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level \"thought\" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.",

The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$.

      "abstract": "We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.",

      "abstract": "Large language models are reshaping programming by enabling 'vibe coding': the development of softwares through natural-language interaction with model-driven toolchains. This article argues that vibe coding is best understood as interface flattening, a reconfiguration in which previously distinct modalities (GUI, CLI, and API) appear to converge into a single conversational surface, even as the underlying chain of translation from intention to machinic effect lengthens and thickens. Drawing on Friedrich Kittler's materialist media theory and Alexander Galloway's account of interfaces as sites of protocol control, the paper situates programming as a historically localised interface arrangement rather than an essential relation to computation. Through a materialist reconstruction of the contemporary vibe-coding stack, it shows how remote compute infrastructures, latency and connectivity, structured outputs, function/tool calling, and interoperability standards such as the Model Context Protocol relocate control and meaning-making power to model and protocol providers. The apparent democratisation of technical capability therefore depends on new dependencies and new literacies. By foregrounding the tension between experiential flattening and infrastructural thickening, I demonstrate how LLM-mediated development redistributes symbolic labour/power, obscures responsibility, and privatises competencies previously dispersed across programming communities, contributing a critical lens on the political economy of AI-mediated human-computer interaction.",

      "abstract": "Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.",

While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.",

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.",

Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.",

We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator.

We formalize \\emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \\emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \\emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.",

For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.",

It combines teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and augmentation of data. Our framework uses a group of teacher models. Their predictions come together through soft voting. An uncertainty-based threshold filters out low-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve learning stability. We also use a confidence-weighted training method that focuses on reliable pseudo-labelled samples. This greatly boosts robustness across languages. Tests on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that our approach consistently beats strong baselines. It significantly reduces the performance gap between settings that have plenty of resources and those that do not. Detailed experiments and studies confirm that our framework is effective and can be used in various situations.

Although recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to improve PE-based interpretation, the lack of a standardized benchmark for end-to-end multi-omics pathway mechanism elucidation has largely confined evaluation to small, manually curated datasets or ad hoc case studies, hindering reproducible progress. To address this issue, we introduce BIOME-Bench, constructed via a rigorous four-stage workflow, to evaluate two core capabilities of LLMs in multi-omics analysis: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation. We develop evaluation protocols for both tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple strong contemporary models. Experimental results demonstrate that existing models still exhibit substantial deficiencies in multi-omics analysis, struggling to reliably distinguish fine-grained biomolecular relation types and to generate faithful, robust pathway-level mechanistic explanations.",

      "abstract": "Evaluating the quality of multi-turn conversations is crucial for developing capable Large Language Models (LLMs), yet remains a significant challenge, often requiring costly human evaluation. Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \\textit{training} techniques, effective automated \\textit{evaluation} specifically for multi-turn interactions lags behind. We observe that standard preference datasets, typically contrasting responses based only on the final conversational turn, provide insufficient signal to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions. Instead, we find that incorporating contrasts spanning \\textit{multiple} turns is critical for building robust multi-turn RMs. Motivated by this finding, we propose \\textbf{MU}lti-\\textbf{S}tep \\textbf{I}nstruction \\textbf{C}ontrast (MUSIC), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs exhibiting differences across multiple turns. Leveraging MUSIC on the Skywork preference dataset, we train a multi-turn RM based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. Empirical results demonstrate that our MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, crucially, without compromising performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Visual word sense disambiguation focuses on polysemous words, where candidate images can be easily confused. Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability. However, due to the challenge of semantic uncertainty, glosses from different sources inevitably carry semantic biases, which can lead to biased disambiguation results. Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, particularly by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models, which further enhances performance. Our approach showcases the potential of quantum machine learning in practical applications and provides a case for leveraging quantum modeling advantages on classical computers while quantum hardware remains immature.",

      "abstract": "We present R-Debater, an agentic framework for generating multi-turn debates built on argumentative memory. Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.",

      "abstract": "We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.",

      "abstract": "We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled \"Commonsense-STEM-Agent\" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news \"slop.\" Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.   Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.   Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.",
